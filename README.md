# Ocean Data Pipeline – Sensor Data Aquisition to Streamlit Viz

This project demonstrates a simple, real-world data engineering pipeline built with Python to ingest, clean, store, and visualize marine sensor data (e.g. from NOAA, EMODnet). Designed to support marine research and monitoring.

## 🚀 Features
- Pulls real-time or historical oceanographic data via API
- Cleans and standardizes the dataset (timestamp, units, missing values)
- Stores processed data in SQLite
- Displays interactive visualizations in a Streamlit dashboard

## 📦 Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, Requests
- SQLite (or DuckDB)
- Streamlit
- Git + GitHub for version control
